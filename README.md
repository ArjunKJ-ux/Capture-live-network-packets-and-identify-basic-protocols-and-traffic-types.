# Capture-live-network-packets-and-identify-basic-protocols-and-traffic-types

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Kali Linux

## What I Did
1. Captured live network traffic using Wireshark.
2. Filtered packets using the `dns` filter.
3. Identified 3 protocols: ARP, DNS, ICMP.
4. Saved the capture as a `.pcap` file.

## Protocols Identified
- **ARP** – Used to find MAC addresses on the network.
- **DNS** – Used to resolve domain names like `google.com`.
- **ICMP** – Seen in ping requests to check connectivity.
